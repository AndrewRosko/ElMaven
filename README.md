## Quick start
Elmaven is supported by both 32 and 64 bit architectures on Ubuntu and Windows.
-  Download the [Maven](https://elucidatainc.github.io/ElMaven/) latest version or daily build depending  on your OS and architecture
- Install Elmaven on [windows](https://elucidatainc.github.io/ElMaven/main/2016/02/12/windows-installation.html) or on [Ubuntu](https://elucidatainc.github.io/ElMaven/main/2016/02/12/ubuntu-installation.html) by following the installation instructions.
- After installing, click on the Elmaven icon to launch Elmaven.
- Elmaven loads with two windows: one for logging the application status and another, Elmaven application window for data analysis.


## Elmaven features
[Maven](http://genomics-pubs.princeton.edu/mzroll/index.php) and [Elmaven](https://elucidatainc.github.io/ElMaven/)  share following features:
* Multi-file chromatographic aligner
* Peak-feature detector
* Isotope and adduct calculator
* Formula predictor
* Pathway visualizer
* Isotopic flux animator

Elmaven is robust, faster and with more user friendly features compared to Maven.
